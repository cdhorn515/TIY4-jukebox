# Jukebox  :radio: :notes:

Built a Jukebox app that uses the SoundCloud API. This application demonstrates my ability to use fetch requests to access data via the SoundCloud API. JavaScript is used to render HTML in the DOM. Event Listeners are used for user input, and Flexbox is used to display the artwork for each of the objects returned from the fetch request in a grid. If there was no artwork for an object, a placeholder image is used.

Users can search for artists, select, and play songs that are returned from the fetch request.

This project is hosted on GitHub pages [here](https://cdhorn515.github.io/week_4-project-soundcloud/).
